　　Fall and football season — feels like the perfect time for a tall bloody mary, spiked with, at the least, fresh horseradish and black pepper.

Maybe you adore the accouterments, whether just celery and a pepperoncini or over-the-top skewers of sausages and fried chicken. Perhaps your tastes appreciate the extra punch of cayenne-infused vodka, or you like to swap the usual flavorless spirit for tequila or gin. (R.I.P. to [1022 South J ](https://www.thenewstribune.com/entertainment/restaurants/tnt-diner/article264780979.html), which served the latter Red Snapper by default. We can look forward to imbibing them at the reincarnation of [Gilman House ](https://www.thenewstribune.com/entertainment/restaurants/tnt-diner/article277941013.html)as Room 428, which specializes in gin.) Heck, it’s also great with just a splash of soda water.

Interestingly, in the United States, the original bloody mary — whose origins likely lay at [Harry’s New York Bar in 1920s Paris ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/paris-marks-bloody-mary-cocktails-100th-birthday)— was mixed with gin. Vodka was relatively rare stateside until the second half of the 20th century. They also weren’t necessarily a daytime-only cure for the prior night’s ills.

Either way, bartender Fernand Petiot is usually credited with combining liquor and tomato juice with salt and pepper, a dash of lemon, Worcestershire and hot sauce. An American named George Jessel brought the vodka into play with a hint of Tabasco, shaken with ice and poured into a highball glass.

In Canada, bars serve the Bloody Caesar, which differs primarily in its use of Clamato, also oft-seen in micheladas.

Some people swear by not shaking a bloody mary, insisting the drink loses too much of its viscosity that way, and will give it a stir in the serving glass. Others insist on [the roll ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He0-N2Z2uCY), which entails carefully sliding the liquid from one tin of a Boston shaker to the other. Shaking introduces too many bubbles, goes the thinking.

They are somewhat of an acquired taste, but where there is brunch, there are bloodies.
